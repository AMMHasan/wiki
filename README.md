# wiki
Only the wiki section of the project will be populated with the solutions to my day to day life hurdle with bioinfo - be it the installation of a software, or a very general aspect that I faced during preparing or running a script. I am just a human and won't be able to remember all the solutions that I already found, therefore, I am going to compile them here.


1. GATK related resources on hg19 (be it the genome assembly or the CNV blacklist or even the panel-of-normal for mutect2) is available here: https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/gatk-best-practices/somatic-b37
click on the file, load the page and download first then transfer to the server of yours.
